      <p>	&#8226; Definition and introduction</p>
      <p>	&#8226; Importance of prayer</p>
      <p>	&#8226; Description of the prayer of prophet Muhammad</p>
      <p>	&#8226; conclusion</p>
      <p>Definition:Salah is an important act of worship that starts with takbeer and ends with tesleem.</p>
      <p>Now that our wudu has been properly made we can proceed and begin to pray salah. Here are the steps of the salah:</p>
      <p>
        Standing
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8226; Takbir
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8226; Fatiha-Recitation
      </p>
      <p>
      	&#8226;  Ruku-Bowing
      </p>
      <p>
      	&#8226;  Sujud-Prostration
      </p>
      <p>
      	&#8226;  Tashahud-Sitting
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand the steps of the salah it is important to understand that the prayer is made up of rakat, or units of prayer. Every rakat has the same basic steps within it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8226; There will be a part when you are standing 
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8226;  A part when you recite from the Quran
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8226;  A part when you bow down 
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8226;  A part where you prostrate (make sujud)
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on which prayer you are performing there will be slight differences in how these rakat are performed. Here is a summary of how each of the five daily prayers differ from one another:
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8226; <strong></strong>  Fajr - has two rakat, or two units
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8226; <strong>Dhur</strong> - has four rakat
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8226; <strong> Asr</strong> - has four rakat
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8226; <strong>Maghrib</strong>  - has three rakat 
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8226; <strong> Isha </strong>- has four rakat
      </p>

   <h2>
    <p>
      Step 1 - Make your intention to pray
    </p>   
   </h2>
   <p>
    We first began the prayer by making an intention from the heart to pray to Allah. As soon as you begin, your entire focus should be on the prayer itself and nothing else.
   </p>
   <h2>
    <p>
      Step 2 - Raise your hands to your ears and say "Allahu Akbar"
    </p>
   </h2>
   <p>
    The moment you say “Allahu Akbar” the prayer will officially begin. From this point forward you should focus wholeheartedly on the prayer and do your best to ignore all distractions.
   </p>
   <h2>
    <p>
      Step 3 - Lower your hands and place them over your chest. Your right hand should be placed over your left hand 
    </p>
   </h2>
   <h2>
    <p>
      Step 4 - Keep your eyes focused on the ground in front of you
    </p>
   </h2>
    <p>
      Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said that while you praying your eyes should always look to where you will prostrate. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it is not obligatory, it is also highly recommended to read the following dua (supplication) after saying Allahu Akbar:
    </p>
    <p>
      subhanakal-lahumma wabihamdika
      watabarakas-muka
      wataa 'ala jadduka
      wala ilaha ghayrak.
    </p>
    <p>
      How perfect you are, O Allah. I praise you
      How blessed is Your name
      How lofty is Your position
      And none has the right to be worshipped but You
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        Step 5 - Recite the opening chapter of the Qur'an 
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first chapter of the Qur'an is called Surah Fatihah. You will begin by saying this Arabic phrase:
    </p>
    <p>
      A'auodu billaahi minash-shaytaanir rajeem
    </p>
    <p>
      "I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Shaytan (devil)."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then begin to recite the chapter verse by verse in Arabic:
    </p>
    <p>
      Bismillaahir ar-Rahmani ar-Raheem

 


    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Al hamdu lillaahi rabbil 'alameen
    </p>
    <p>
      Ar-Rahmani ar-Raheem
    </p>
    <p>
      Maaliki yawmid deen
    </p>
    <p>
      Iyyaaka na'aboodu wa iyyaaka nasta'een
    </p>
    <p>
      Ihdeenas siraatal mustaqeem
    </p> 
    <p>
      Siraatal ladheena an 'amta' alayhim
      Ghairil maghduubi 'alaihim wala dewleen 
    </p> 
    <h3>
      <p>
        This is the meaning of the verses from Surah Fatihah:
      </p>
    </h3>

    <p>
      In the name of God, the infinitely Compassionate and Merciful. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      Praise be to Allah, Lord of all the worlds.
    </p> 
    <p>
      The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      Master on the Day of Recompense (Judgement Day).
    </p>
    <p>
      You alone do we worship, and You alone do we ask for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guide us on the straight path,
    </p>
    <p>
      The path of those who You have bestowed favour, not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray.
    </p>
    <p>
      After reciting Surah Fatihah, you can recite another chapter from the Qur'an. However, at a minimum you must recite Surah Fatiha in every rakat of prayer.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
       Step 6 - Bow down. This is known as the "ruku"
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      As you are bowing down say "Allahu Akbar". Make sure to keep your back straight, your hands on your knees, and your eyes focused on the ground where you will be prostrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are in this position you will say this sentence three times:
    </p>
    <p>
      Subhana rabbiyal adheem
    </p>
    <p>
      'How perfect is my Lord, the Magnificent'
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        Step 7 - Return to standing up again
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      As you are rising up from the ruku position to a standing position you will bring your hands to your ears and will say:
    </p>  
    <p>
      Samee Allahu liman hamidah
    </p>
    <p>
      'Allah hears those who praise him'
    </p>
    <p>
      And when you are standing upright then lower your hands to your waist and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      Rabbana walakal hamd 
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our Lord, to You is all praise'
    </p>
    <h2>
      Step 8 - Go down to perform prostration. This is known as "sujud"
    </h2>
    <p>
      As you are moving into this position say Allahu Akbar.
    </p>
    <p>
      And also make sure your forehead, nose, palms of both hands, knees, and both toes are touching the ground  
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>  
Step 9 - Say this phrase while in sujud (prostration)
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Say this sentence three times:
    </p>
    <p>
      Subhana rabbeeyal 'a'la 
    </p>
    <p>
      How perfect is my Lord, the Most High
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        Step 10 - Rise up from sujud and sit for a moment 
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Say Allahu akbar as you rise from sujud and then sit on your left leg. Your left foot will rest on the floor while your right foot is upright. Place your hands on your knees.  
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are in this position it is recommended to ask Allah for forgiveness. A simple and easy dua you can say is:
    </p>
    <p>
      Rabbigh-fir lee 
    </p>
    <p>
      O my Lord, forgive me.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        Step 11 - Return to the position of sujud  
      </p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      You will repeat step 9 again and perform a second sujood and say subhana rabbeeyal 'a'la three times again. 
    </p>
    <h2>
      <p>
        Step 12 - Arise from the sujud to return to the standing position and say Allahu Akbar
      </p>
    </h2>
      <h2>
        <p>
        Step 13 - Perform the tashahhud at the end of every two rakat
        </p>
      </h2>
    <p>
      Instead of standing up after the two sujud, this time around you will sit on your legs and knees again. You will raise your right index finger and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      Attahiyat lillahi was Salawaatu wat tayyibaat,
      Assalaamu 'alaika ayyuhan nabiyyu wa rahmatu Allahi wa barakaatuh,
      Assalaamu 'alaynaa wa 'alaa 'ebaadillaahis saaliheen,
      Ash hadu allaa ilaha illa Allah Wa ash hadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa rasuluh.
    </p>
    <p>
      All compliments, prayers and pure words are due to Allah. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace be upon us, and on the righteous slaves of Allah.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger 
    </p>
    <p>
      If this is the final rakat in the prayer then you will add this part to the tashahhud: 
    </p>
    <p>
      Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammad, wa 'ala aali Muhammad,
      Kama salayta 'ala Ibraaheem, wa 'ala aali Ibrahim,
      Innaka Hameedun Majeed.
      Wa baarik 'ala Muhammad, wa 'ala aali Muhammad,
      Kamaa baarakta 'ala Ibraaheem, wa 'ala aali Ibrahim,
      Innaka Hameedun Majeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and upon the family (or followers) of Muhammad, Just as You sent prayers upon Ibrahim and the family (or followers) of Ibrahim,
      Verily, you are full of Praise and Majesty.
      O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family (or followers) of Muhammad as You blessed Ibrahim and the family (or followers) of Ibraaheem,
      Verily, you are full of Praise and Majesty.
       
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The 'tasleem':</strong> after reciting the second part of the tashahhud, you will say the "tasleem"
    </p>
    <p>
      The tasleem is to look to your right and say:
      Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatu Allah

    </p>
    <p>
      And then to look to the left and say it again:
    </p>
    <p>
      Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatu Allah 
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon saying the tasleem the prayer will have come to an end.
